# ElectrumSV Seed Tool

A secure, offline tool for generating and managing Bitcoin SV (BSV) wallet seeds with advanced security features.

## Features

- üîí **Offline Operation**: Designed to run completely offline for maximum security
- üé≤ **Cryptographically Secure**: Uses system entropy and secure random number generation
- üîê **Strong Encryption**: AES-256-GCM encryption for wallet data
- üì± **QR Code Support**: Generate QR codes for easy air-gapped transfer
- üì¨ **Address Generation**: Generate multiple addresses from a single seed
- üß™ **Self-Test Mode**: Comprehensive test suite to verify functionality
- üîç **Security Checks**: Runtime security verification
- üõ°Ô∏è **Memory Protection**: Secure memory handling and cleanup
- üìù **Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive operation logging

## Security Features

- **Entropy Generation**: Uses system entropy sources for true randomness
- **Memory Protection**: 
  - Memory locking to prevent swapping
  - Secure memory wiping
  - Protected memory regions
- **Secure Deletion**: 
  - Secure file deletion
  - Shell history cleanup
  - Python history cleanup
- **Password Protection**:
  - Strong password requirements
  - Rate-limited decryption attempts
  - Secure password handling
- **Paranoid Mode**: Optional ASCII-only QR code generation
- **Print-Only Mode**: Optional mode to prevent file writing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nedzof/offline_seed_gen.git
cd offline_seed_gen
```

2. Install dependencies locally:
```bash
./install_deps.sh
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
./main.py
```

This will:
1. Perform security checks
2. Generate a new wallet
3. Encrypt the wallet data
4. Save the encrypted data
5. Optionally generate QR codes

### Command Line Options

- `--paranoid`: Run in paranoid mode (ASCII QR only)
- `--print-only`: Run in print-only mode (no file output)
- `--selftest`: Run self-test and exit
- `--addresses N`: Generate QR code with N addresses (e.g., `--addresses 1000`)

### Examples

```bash
# Generate a new wallet with default settings
./main.py

# Generate a wallet and create QR code with 1000 addresses
./main.py --addresses 1000

# Generate addresses in paranoid mode (ASCII QR only)
./main.py --addresses 1000 --paranoid

# Generate addresses without saving files
./main.py --addresses 1000 --print-only
```

### Security Recommendations

1. **Run Offline**: Always run this tool on an offline system
2. **Use Xorg**: Prefer Xorg over Wayland for better security
3. **Internal Storage**: Copy the tool to internal storage before running
4. **Network Check**: Double-check network connectivity is disabled
5. **Secure Storage**: Store backups securely and never share your seed phrase
6. **Password Management**: Use a strong, unique password for encryption
7. **Secure Environment**: Run in a clean, secure environment
8. **Regular Updates**: Keep the tool updated with the latest security patches

## Password Requirements

The tool enforces strong password requirements:
- Minimum 12 characters
- Must contain uppercase letters
- Must contain lowercase letters
- Must contain numbers
- Must contain special characters

## QR Code Generation

The tool can generate QR codes in two modes:
1. **Standard Mode**: Generates both image and ASCII QR codes
2. **Paranoid Mode**: Generates ASCII QR codes only

### Types of QR Codes

1. **Wallet Information QR Code**
   - Contains mnemonic phrase
   - Contains passphrase
   - Contains derivation path
   - Contains version information

2. **Addresses QR Code**
   - Contains multiple addresses
   - Each address includes:
     - Index number
     - Bitcoin SV address
     - Derivation path
   - Formatted as JSON for easy parsing
   - Can generate up to 1000 addresses

## Self-Test Mode

Run comprehensive tests with:
```bash
./main.py --selftest
```

Tests include:
- Entropy generation
- Mnemonic generation
- Encryption/Decryption
- QR code generation
- Password strength validation

## File Structure

- `main.py`: Main script
- `install_deps.sh`: Dependency installation script
- `lib/`: Local dependencies
- `qr_bundle/`: Generated QR codes
- `wallet_info.txt`: Encrypted wallet data

## Dependencies

Local dependencies are managed in the `lib` directory:
- `pycryptodomex`: Cryptographic operations
- `qrcode`: QR code generation
- `bitcoinx`: Bitcoin SV operations

## Security Considerations

### Memory Safety
- Memory is locked to prevent swapping
- Sensitive data is securely wiped
- Protected memory regions are used

### File Safety
- Secure file deletion
- History cleanup
- Temporary file handling

### Network Safety
- Offline operation
- Network connectivity checks
- Air-gapped transfer support
