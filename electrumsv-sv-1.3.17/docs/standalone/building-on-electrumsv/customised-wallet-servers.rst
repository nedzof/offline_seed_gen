Wallet as a service
===================

As the Bitcoin SV ecosystem matures services will become available that allow businesses to
outsource the wallet management and the services necessary for their products. There is a sizeable
advantage to this, as it allows the business to focus on the products and avoid complicated and
rather standard work that there is a benefit to outsourcing.

For the businesses that want or even need to be in control of their own wallet and infrastructure,
they can treat ElectrumSV as a common open source base, and extend it with their own
proprietary functionality. An starting point for this approach can be found in the
`example application <https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/tree/master/examples/applications>`_
on Github.

This documentation will be fleshed out as time allows.
