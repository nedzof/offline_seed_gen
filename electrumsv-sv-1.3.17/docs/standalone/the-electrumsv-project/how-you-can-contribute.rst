How you can contribute
======================

What are some of the ways you might contribute to ElectrumSV?

- Contributing translations.
- Contributing new features.
- Contributing bug fixes.
- Reporting problems.

Translations
------------

Anyone wishing to contribute translations of the text in the ElectrumSV user interface, can do
so by the `ElectrumSV project <https://crowdin.com/project/electrumsv>`_ on Crowdin. Once you've
done entering translations let us know, and we'll do the process of exporting the latest
data from Crowdin so that your transaction work gets used.

New features
------------

Be aware that you should check with us before starting work on a feature you are hoping we
will accept into ElectrumSV. If we accept a new feature, we then have to maintain it and accept
the extra work involved on top of that required for support requests, current features and bug
fixes. And it may be that depending on the feature we cannot remove it later, if users become
reliant on it or have data that requires it to be present.

Bug fixes
---------

We welcome bug fixes for existing problems, whether they are problems you encounter yourself or
ones that you see others have reported that have not already been fixed. You can find our
`existing bugs <https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues>`_ in our issue tracker on Github.

Reporting problems
------------------

Even if you do not have the experience, skill or inclination to attempt to fix problems you
encounter, it would be appreciated if you could report them to us. And if you can take the time
to describe what you were doing when you encountered the problem, it helps us fix the problems
much more easily. You can
`report bugs <https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues/new/choose>`_ using our template
in our issue tracker on Github.
