Warning
-------

ElectrumSV to 1.3.14.

Useful information
------------------

Do you need an introduction to how ElectrumSV works?
====================================================

We have a selected range of guides to common tasks that our users may want to do in our
documentation, please `check it out <https://electrumsv.readthedocs.io/>`__.

Where can you download ElectrumSV?
==================================

The only safe downloads are available from: `electrumsv.io <https://electrumsv.io/>`__

Where can you get help?
=======================

Find our `issue tracker here <https://github.com/electrumsv/electrumsv/issues>`__ where you can
create a ticket. Fill out the issue template, please! Otherwise we have no idea what steps you
took or any of the other details and then we have to spend time asking you them anyway and you
get help much later. **Fill out the template for your own sake, if not ours!**

We do not provide support over Twitter or any other forms of social media. Not only is it not
guaranteed we will see your comments, it is a very painful way to do support that we avoid. If
you need support, submit an issue on our issue tracker. Or you can raise subjects of interest on
`Unwriter’s Slack <https://atlantis.planaria.network/>`__, or the
`Metanet.ICU Slack <http://metanet.icu/>`__.

If you are a MacOS user and cannot install/run our latest release, please
`read this article <https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/unsigned.html>`__.
