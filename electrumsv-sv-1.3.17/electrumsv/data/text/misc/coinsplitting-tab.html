<h2>The Coin-splitting tab</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Provisional in-wallet help</i></p>
<p>
If the account is thought to contain coins that are linked on both the Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin
Cash blockchains, then there is a danger that if they are used on the Bitcoin SV blockchain they
may accidentally also be used on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain.
</p>
<p>
    This tab is intended to help our wallet owners try and safely unlink the coins in their account,
    especially since some of these users may not understand what they are doing. You can read an
    article on the subject of
    <a target="_new" href="https://medium.com/@roger.taylor/understanding-coin-splitting-94080819414">
    understanding coin-splitting</a> (external link), and it is recommended that you do so.
</p>
<h3>Splitting directly (recommended)</h3>
<p>
    This approach works differently depending on whether the account is multi-signature or
    just the wallet owner signing a transaction. Check the relevant section for details.
</p>
<h4>Single signer</h4>
<p>
    If the current account supports splitting directly, then the user can just click the split
    button, enter their password and the coins should split right away.
</p>
<p>
    This cannot work with hardware wallet accounts. Hardware wallets only sign outgoing payments
    to simple one-party recipients. The approach used here is not one of the limited types of
    simple outgoing payments they support.
</p>
<h4>Multi-signature signed</h4>
<p>
    While a single signer account owner can just be prompted to enter their password and the
    process is almost completely taken care of for them, a multi-signature account requires that
    enough cosigners be involved through the normal signing coordination process.
</p>
<p>
    Clicking the split button will create an unsigned transaction and preview it, in much the
    same way that many mulit-signature account cosigners might already do to start the signing
    process. After previewing the transaction, it is their responsibility to go through their
    normal signing coordination process.
</p>
<h3>Splitting using the faucet</h3>
<p>
    The advantage of using the faucet is that it provides a small amount of Bitcoin SV in the form
    of a simple incoming payment to be used to aid in the splitting process. This can be included
    with coins from the account, and through it's presence, makes other coins it is involved with
    only linked to the Bitcoin SV blockchain (split).
</p>
<p>
    Because a hardware wallet can use this small amount of Bitcoin SV and does not have to sign
    anything that isn't very simple, it can split coins using this method.
</p>
<h3>Splitting manually</h3>
<p>
    If a wallet owner does not want to combine all the coins in their wallet, then they might
    want to enable the ability to create Bitcoin SV only transactions, and split their coins
    manually. This is manually doing what the direct approach does, but with the user taking
    control and is covered further in the help section for the <a href="send-tab.html">Send tab</a>.
