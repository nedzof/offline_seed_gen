<h2>Choosing a wallet</h2>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Provisional in-wallet help</i></p>
<p>
    This page allows you to either create a new wallet or select an existing wallet to load.
    If you want to create a new wallet, click on the button provided for that purpose. Otherwise,
    if you want to select an existing wallet there are a range of ways you can do this.

    <ul>
        <li>If the wallet you want to select is one of those that were most recently opened, you
            can locate it in the list of recently opened wallets and either double-click on it
            or click on the button provided to open a selected wallet.</li>
        <li>If the wallet you want to select is not in the list of recently opened wallets, you
            can click on the button provided to open another wallet.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3>Creating a new wallet</h3>
<p>
    On choosing to create a new wallet, you will be first asked to select where it will be located
    and what it will be called. After doing so, you will then be asked to provide a password for
    the wallet &mdash; while in the past it was possible to have a wallet without a password, this
    is no longer supported. Finally, the new and empty wallet will be created and this wizard will
    close and the wallet user interface opened.
</p>
<p>
    New wallets require their user to create an initial account before they can be used. For now,
    a wallet can only have one account, but when the wallet user interface has been redesigned
    to support multiple accounts this restriction will be removed.
</p>
<h3>Selecting an existing wallet</h3>
<p>
    Whichever method you use to select an existing wallet, depending on what that wallet is,
    there are several things that might happen. If the wallet storage is the latest one required
    by this version of ElectrumSV, then it will be opened. If it is an older storage format, then
    it required going through a migration process to update it, before it can open.
</p>
<h4>Wallet storage formats</h4>
<p>
    As of ElectrumSV 1.3.0, the wallet storage has changed from a JSON file to a database file.
    There are numerous reasons for this change that will not be documented here. Versions 1.2.5
    and earlier use a JSON file. Versions 1.3.0 and above use a database file.
</p>
<p>
    There are three different ways in which a wallet in the older JSON format might work:

    <ol>
        <li><b>Unpassworded:</b> The saved wallet file was just the direct text of the JSON format.
            Anyone could open the file in a text editor and see not only the private keys, but
            also any seed words for that wallet.</li>
        <li><b>Password with key encryption:</b> The saved wallet file was the direct text of the
            JSON format. However the most critical data like private keys and seed words was
            encrypted with the password.</li>
        <li><b>Password with file encryption:</b> The saved wallet file was completely encrypted
            with the password. In addition to this, critical data was also encrypted according
            in the same way as basic passworded wallets.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h4>Migration</h4>
<p>
    The specific subject of wallet migration is not covered in this document, you can read about
    that if you are on the wallet migration wizard step. However, what the wallet selection process
    will ask you to do before proceeding to that step, depends on your wallet's format.
</p>
<p>
    Unpassworded JSON wallets will require the user to provide a password, before migration is
    attempted. The password will be used to encrypt keys in the database, that were not previously
    encrypted in the original JSON wallet. Passworded wallets will require the user to provide the
    JSON wallet's existing password.
</p>
<h3>Wallet encryption</h3>
<p>
    The naive way the wallets were stored using JSON was problematic, but because it was naive
    it allowed a simple encryption of the entire wallet file as part of the process of writing
    all the wallet data to disk. As long as no-one really used their wallets much, and they didn't
    create many transactions this was fine and it was workable.
</p>
<p>
    With Bitcoin SV, a user may decide to store all their data on-chain. To continue to use the
    JSON files, would mean that potentially gigabytes if not terabytes of data would need to be
    loaded and decrypted every time the wallet was used. And it would all need to be encrypted and
    saved every time the wallet was exited.
</p>
<p>
    For now the new database wallet files use key encryption. This is where only critical private
    key-related data like actual private keys or seed words, are encrypted in the database.
    We did prototype full privacy, but it complicated things to the point where it was unlikely
    we would ever make a release. So we stepped back and did what was feasible.
</p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>
    One concern about there no longer a way for wallets to have full encryption of all data,
    is that the balance, transactions and other data can be viewed if someone has access to
    your computer. However, if someone has access to your computer this is of less concern
    than their ability to run software that may extract your private keys when you access them
    &mdash; something that can be done regardless of full on-disk encryption of a wallet!
</p>
<p>
    If a user really wants full privacy, and full on-disk encryption of their wallet they have
    two options.

    <ul>
        <li>They can work with us and write support for it and we can merge their implementation
            in for all users.</li>
        <li>They can decrypt their wallet database before they load it, and encrypt it after they
            have finished with it. This could be done manually each time, within a script that
            automates wallet loading or implicitly done with full encryption of the disk the wallet
            is stored on.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
