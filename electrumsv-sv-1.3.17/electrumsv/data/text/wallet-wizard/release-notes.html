        </p>
        <p>This is 1.3.17, a unofficial release to deal with broken servers. Use at own risk.</p>
        <p>
            The most prominent changes are also summarised below for convenience, if you wish to read more
            about any given change, please read the linked article.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>
    <b>Security</b>: Due to the packages we depend on, we bundle the root certificates that are used
    to verify that when we connect to a web site it is the legitimate web site. One of these
    certificates was revoked, and we need to do a release to provide a version of the wallet
    that does not contain that revoked certificate. The version of the `certifi` package we
    include has been updated.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
    <b>User interface</b>: There seems to be a bug where restoring a wallet would leave the history
    tab list of transactions not correctly updated. Specifically, the dates would still show
    "Unknown" despite the transaction having been verified as in a block with the merkle proof.
    It should have been updated with the date of the block. A workaround was added to force
    an update, but the whole model seems to need a rewrite however the current focus is on the
    1.4 release.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
    <b>User friendliness</b>: We do not include all the past blockchain headers with the wallet, and
    before the wallet can work properly it used to download all the headers. Nowadays we have
    built-in checkpointing so that we can fetch the headers we need on demand, and not require
    that long startup time. In order to make this release more user-friendly, we have updated
    the mainnet and testnet header checkpoints.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
    <b>Reliability</b>: There is an occasional bug where the file headers are stored in does not get
    written correctly. This mainly happens on Windows, but has been observed on Linux. We have
    included a fix that flushes and closes the file storage on exit, and should hopefully fix
    this rare but continuing problem.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
    <b>Documentation</b>: The documentation covering how to verify your download with our PGP signatures
    referred to a different file suffix ".sig" for the file signatures rather than ".asc" which
    the tooling appears to have switched to, causing user confusion. This has now been aligned
    with the tooling, and uses ".asc".
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
    <b>Exchange rates</b>: Removed Bitfinex as source of exchange rates.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
    <b>Servers</b>: Updated the hard-coded servers list. There were a lot of stale servers that no longer
    exist. satoshi.vision.cash appears to be pruned and does not have the transactions for wallet
    restoration.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
    <b>Python</b>: Update build version of Python to 3.9.16. On MacOS we had to upgrade to 3.9.16 for
    builds to ensure that we include the latest fixes that allow builds made on later versions of
    MacOS (13.3+) to run on earlier versions (11.1+). Most users should be running a build, so
    this should only affect those running from source. However the last version of 3.9 suitable
    for local development on Windows due to installers being available is 3.9.13, so this is the
    enforced minimum version.
